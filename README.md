# Final-Project-SMLR
Instructions:
In this Assignment, you will demonstrate the data regression skills you have learned by completing this course. You are expected to leverage a wide variety of tools, but also this report should focus on present findings, insights, and next steps. You may include some visuals from your code output, but this report is intended as a summary of your findings, not as a code review.

The grading will center around 5 main points:

Does the report include a section describing the data?
Does the report include a paragraph detailing the main objective(s) of this analysis?
Does the report include a section with variations of linear regression models and specifies which one is the model that best suits the main objective(s) of this analysis.
Does the report include a clear and well-presented section with key findings related to the main objective(s) of the analysis?
Does the report highlight possible flaws in the model and a plan of action to revisit this analysis with additional data or different predictive modeling techniques?
